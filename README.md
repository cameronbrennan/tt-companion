## Table Top Companion 

1. Table Top Companion is a MERN-Stack, fully responsive web app designed to make it easy for Table Top RPG players to create and view potential character builds.
2. Currently, TTC is built using the Dungeons and Dragons, 5th Edition API (http://www.dnd5eapi.co/) to provide character Race and Class benefits and information, but long term is planned to have integration with Pathfinder and other community favorite Table Top RPG rule sets.
3. The application will allow a play to signup (or login if they have an account) and create/view/update their character builds through an intuitive and informative interface that provides immediate feedback on the results of these build decisions.
4. Currently, the only core component to the character create process that is absent from TTCompanion's creation process is the selection of skill proficiencies, although this feature will be added very soon!
